# AtlantBH-Project

This repository is created as a part of a project/task done for the selection process for Atlant BH.


## Testing E-commerce application

Part of the project was to investigate [demo e-commerce application](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) and to write test cases for this application concentrating on real user flows. 

After identifying Smoke Test from the test cases created, the next step was to automate that smoke test with a programming/scripting language and testing framework of choice. 

Therefore, the Github repository was created for the purpose and pushing the assignment solution so it can be readily available for review.

The test is written in the Cypress framework which is built on JavaScript.
